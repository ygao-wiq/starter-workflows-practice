# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

The Awesome GitHub Copilot repository is a community-driven collection of custom agents and instructions designed to enhance GitHub Copilot experiences across various domains, languages, and use cases. The project includes:

- **Agents** - Specialized GitHub Copilot agents that integrate with MCP servers
- **Instructions** - Coding standards and best practices applied to specific file patterns
- **Skills** - Self-contained folders with instructions and bundled resources for specialized tasks
- **Hooks** - Automated workflows triggered by specific events during development
- **Workflows** - [Agentic Workflows](https://github.github.com/gh-aw) for AI-powered repository automation in GitHub Actions
- **Plugins** - Installable packages that group related agents, hooks, and skills around specific themes

## Development Workflow

### Working with Agents, Instructions, Skills, and Hooks

All agent files (`*.agent.md`) and instruction files (`*.instructions.md`) must include proper markdown front matter. Agent Skills are folders containing a `SKILL.md` file with frontmatter and optional bundled assets. Hooks are folders containing a `README.md` with frontmatter and a `hooks.json` configuration file:

#### Agent Files (\*.agent.md)

- Must have `description` field (wrapped in single quotes)
- File names should be lower case with words separated by hyphens
- Recommended to include `tools` field
- Strongly recommended to specify `model` field

#### Instruction Files (\*.instructions.md)

- Must have `description` field (wrapped in single quotes, not empty)
- Must have `applyTo` field specifying file patterns (e.g., `'**.js, **.ts'`)
- File names should be lower case with words separated by hyphens

#### Agent Skills (skills/\*/SKILL.md)

- Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file
- SKILL.md must have `name` field (lowercase with hyphens, matching folder name, max 64 characters)
- SKILL.md must have `description` field (wrapped in single quotes, 10-1024 characters)
- Folder names should be lower case with words separated by hyphens
- Skills can include bundled assets (scripts, templates, data files)
- Bundled assets should be referenced in the SKILL.md instructions
- Asset files should be reasonably sized (under 5MB per file)
- Skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)

#### Canvas Extensions (extensions/\*)

- Each extension folder must include `extension.mjs`
- Extensions are reusable source components, not standalone plugins
- A shippable extension plugin is registered by a matching `plugins/<extension-id>/plugin.json`
- A plugin can bundle additional reusable extensions by listing `./extensions/<name>` paths in `extensions.com.github.awesome-copilot.extensions`
- Each extension must have `assets/preview.png` as the primary visual asset
- Extension metadata is sourced from the matching plugin manifest in `plugins/`

#### Hook Folders (hooks/\*/README.md)

- Each hook is a folder containing a `README.md` file with frontmatter
- README.md must have `name` field (human-readable name)
- README.md must have `description` field (wrapped in single quotes, not empty)
- Must include a `hooks.json` file with hook configuration (hook events extracted from this file)
- Folder names should be lower case with words separated by hyphens
- Can include bundled assets (scripts, utilities, configuration files)
- Bundled scripts should be referenced in the README.md and hooks.json
- Follow the [GitHub Copilot hooks specification](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/use-hooks)
- Optionally includes `tags` field for categorization

#### Workflow Files (workflows/\*.md)

- Each workflow is a standalone `.md` file in the `workflows/` directory
- Must have `name` field (human-readable name)
- Must have `description` field (wrapped in single quotes, not empty)
- Contains agentic workflow frontmatter (`on`, `permissions`, `safe-outputs`) and natural language instructions
- File names should be lower case with words separated by hyphens
- Only `.md` files are accepted — `.yml`, `.yaml`, and `.lock.yml` files are blocked by CI
- Follow the [GitHub Agentic Workflows specification](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/workflow-structure/)

#### Plugin Folders (plugins/\*)

- Each plugin is a folder containing a root `plugin.json` file with metadata
- plugin.json **must** have `"$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json"` (Agent Plugins v1.0.0)
- plugin.json must have `name` field (matching the folder name)
- plugin.json must have `description` field (describing the plugin's purpose)
- plugin.json must have `version` field (semantic version, e.g., "1.0.0")
- Plugin content is defined declaratively in plugin.json under `extensions.com.github.awesome-copilot` using source-only composition fields (`agents`, `hooks`, `skills`, and `extensions`). Source files live in top-level directories and are materialized into plugins by CI. This namespace is stripped from the served manifest — skills use the standard `skills/` directory and Copilot-specific content uses `com.github.copilot/`.
- MCP servers are **not** a composition field. Per the Agent Plugins spec they are declared in an `mcp.json` file at the plugin root, which is committed alongside `plugin.json` and shipped as-is. Do not add `mcpServers` to `plugin.json`, and do not use the legacy `.mcp.json` filename.
- The `marketplace.json` file is automatically generated from all plugins during build
- Plugins are discoverable and installable via GitHub Copilot CLI

### Adding New Resources

When adding a new agent, instruction, skill, hook, workflow, or plugin:

**For Agents and Instructions:**

1. Create the file with proper front matter
2. Add the file to the appropriate directory
3. Update the README.md by running: `npm run build`
4. Verify the resource appears in the generated README

**For Hooks:**

1. Create a new folder in `hooks/` with a descriptive name
2. Create `README.md` with proper frontmatter (name, description, hooks, tags)
3. Create `hooks.json` with hook configuration following GitHub Copilot hooks spec
4. Add any bundled scripts or assets to the folder
5. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x script.sh`
6. Update the README.md by running: `npm run build`
7. Verify the hook appears in the generated README

**For Workflows:**

1. Create a new `.md` file in `workflows/` with a descriptive name (e.g., `daily-issues-report.md`)
2. Include frontmatter with `name` and `description`, plus agentic workflow fields (`on`, `permissions`, `safe-outputs`)
3. Compile with `gh aw compile --validate` to verify it's valid
4. Update the README.md by running: `npm run build`
5. Verify the workflow appears in the generated README

**For Skills:**

1. Run `npm run skill:create` to scaffold a new skill folder
2. Edit the generated SKILL.md file with your instructions
3. Add any bundled assets (scripts, templates, data) to the skill folder
4. Run `npm run skill:validate` to validate the skill structure
5. Update the README.md by running: `npm run build`
6. Verify the skill appears in the generated README

**For Plugins:**

1. Run `npm run plugin:create -- --name <plugin-name>` to scaffold a new plugin
2. Define agents, hooks, skills, and reusable extensions under `extensions.com.github.awesome-copilot` in `plugin.json`
3. Edit the generated `plugin.json` with your metadata
4. Run `npm run plugin:validate` to validate the plugin structure
5. Run `npm run build` to update README.md and marketplace.json
6. Verify the plugin appears in `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`

**For Canvas Extensions:**

1. Create/update the extension in `extensions/<extension-id>/` with `extension.mjs`
2. Add the matching plugin manifest under `plugins/<extension-id>/plugin.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json",
     "name": "<extension-id>",
     "description": "...",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "extensions": {
       "com.github.copilot": {
         "logo": "assets/preview.png"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Ensure `assets/preview.png` exists as the primary visual asset
4. Run `npm run plugin:validate` to validate plugin and extension metadata
5. Run `npm run build` to regenerate website data and marketplace output

To bundle an extension into another plugin without making a second source copy, add sorted `./extensions/<name>` paths to `plugins/<plugin-id>/plugin.json` under `extensions.com.github.awesome-copilot.extensions`.

**For External Plugins:**

1. Do not open a direct PR that edits `plugins/external.json` for a public third-party plugin submission
2. Public external plugin submissions use the external plugin issue workflow documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-external-plugins)
3. In v1, only GitHub-hosted plugins are accepted for public submission, using a public repo plus an immutable `ref`, `sha`, or both
4. The shared validator in `eng/external-plugin-validation.mjs` is the canonical source of truth for external plugin data rules; reuse it instead of duplicating checks in scripts or workflows
5. Submission issues move through `external-plugin` + `awaiting-review` and then either `ready-for-review` or `requires-submitter-fixes` based on automated quality gates
6. While a submission issue is open, the issue author or a maintainer can comment `/rerun-intake` to re-run automated intake and quality gates. Maintainer-rejected issues are terminal; contributors who address the rejection feedback must open a new submission issue
7. Maintainers can explicitly override a quality-gate blocker with `/mark-ready-for-review [optional reason]`, which moves the issue to `ready-for-review`
8. Maintainers make the decision with `/approve` or `/reject <reason>` issue comments once the issue is in `ready-for-review`; approved issues are closed and used as the six-month re-review anchor
9. Approval automation creates or updates the PR against `main`, updates `plugins/external.json`, and regenerates marketplace outputs
10. Nightly re-review automation finds closed `external-plugin` + `approved` issues that are at least six months old, applies `re-review-due`, and opens or updates a tracking issue for maintainers
11. Maintainers complete re-review on the original approved submission issue with `/re-review-keep`, `/re-review-needs-changes`, or `/re-review-remove`; keep resets the issue `closed_at`, and remove opens a PR against `main`

### Testing Instructions

```bash
# Run all validation checks
npm run plugin:validate
npm run skill:validate

# Build and verify README generation
npm run build

# Fix line endings (required before committing)
bash eng/fix-line-endings.sh
```

Before committing:

- Ensure all markdown front matter is correctly formatted
- Verify file names follow the lower-case-with-hyphens convention
- Run `npm run build` to update the README
- **Always run `bash eng/fix-line-endings.sh`** to normalize line endings (CRLF → LF)
- Check that your new resource appears correctly in the README

## Code Style Guidelines

### Markdown Files

- Use proper front matter with required fields
- Keep descriptions concise and informative
- Wrap description field values in single quotes
- Use lower-case file names with hyphens as separators

### JavaScript/Node.js Scripts

- Located in `eng/` and `scripts/` directories
- Follow Node.js ES module conventions (`.mjs` extension)
- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names

## Pull Request Guidelines

When creating a pull request:

> **Important:** All pull requests should target the **`main`** branch, not `staged`.

1. **README updates**: New files should automatically be added to the README when you run `npm run build`
2. **Front matter validation**: Ensure all markdown files have the required front matter fields
3. **File naming**: Verify all new files follow the lower-case-with-hyphens naming convention
4. **Build check**: Run `npm run build` before committing to verify README generation
5. **Line endings**: **Always run `bash eng/fix-line-endings.sh`** to normalize line endings to LF (Unix-style)
6. **Description**: Provide a clear description of what your agent/instruction does
7. **Testing**: If adding a plugin, run `npm run plugin:validate` to ensure validity
