# ContextMatic Plugin

Coding agents hallucinate APIs. APIMatic Context gives them curated, versioned API and SDK docs.

When a developer asks their agent to "integrate the payments API," it normally guesses, pulling from outdated training data or generic patterns that don't match the actual SDK. ContextMatic solves this by giving the agent authoritative, version-aware, SDK-native context at the exact moment it's needed.

## What ContextMatic Does

ContextMatic gives GitHub Copilot version-aware API and SDK guidance grounded in real API definitions and SDKs instead of generic public examples. It helps with:

- API discovery by project language
- Authentication and quickstart guidance
- Endpoint lookup with parameter and response details
- Model lookup with typed property definitions

## Supported APIs

The plugin gives the agent SDK-native context for the following APIs, available in TypeScript, C#, Python, Java, PHP, and Ruby:

## What the Plugin Gives the Agent

Once installed, the plugin exposes seven tools to the agent. Each tool is mapped to a specific stage of the integration workflow:

| Tool              | Developer task it enables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fetch_api`       | Provides an exact API match or lists all available APIs for the provided `language`, including each API's name, key, and description. Pass your project's language and an API `key` for an exact-match lookup (returns only that API). The full API catalog for that `language` is returned if no exact match is found. The agent calls this first to discover which APIs are available. |
| `ask`             | Chat with API Copilot for step-by-step integration guidance and general API questions: authentication setup, client initialization, feature behavior, framework-specific patterns (e.g. "How do I initialize the Twilio client in Laravel?"), and idiomatic SDK code samples.                                                                             |
| `endpoint_search` | Returns an SDK endpoint method's description, input parameters, and response shape by method name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `model_search`    | Returns an SDK model's full definition and its typed properties by name. Call this before writing code that constructs request bodies or reads response objects.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `update_activity` | Records concrete integration milestones such as SDK setup, auth configuration, the first successful API call, and resolved errors. The agent calls this after a milestone has actually been reached in code or infrastructure.                                                                                                       |
| `add_guidelines`  | Adds language-specific guideline files such as security, testing, or workflow guidance that the agent can follow during implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `add_skills`      | Adds reusable project skills such as `{language}-conventions` so future API integration work can follow the project's language-specific conventions.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

For step-by-step guidance on using these tools together, invoke the `/integrate-context-matic` skill in your agent. It tells the agent when and how to call each tool throughout your integration workflow.

## From Prompt to Code: How the Tools Work Together

The seven tools are designed to chain together in a natural integration workflow. Here is a concrete example of what happens under the hood when the agent receives a real task:

**Your prompt:** _"/integrate-context-matic Add Twilio SMS notifications to my Next.js app. Send a text when an order ships."_

| Step | Tool called                                                                       | What it returns                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `add_guidelines` (`language=typescript`)                                          | Adds project guideline files the agent can follow for security, testing, and implementation workflow before starting the API integration.                                 |
| 2    | `add_skills` (`language=typescript`)                                              | Adds reusable language-specific skills such as conventions guidance so the project setup matches future integration work.                                                 |
| 3    | `fetch_api` (`language=typescript`, `key="twilio"`)                               | Exact match found — returns Twilio's entry with its name, key, and description                                                                                            |
| 4    | `ask` (`key=twilio`, query=_"How do I initialize the Twilio TypeScript client?"_) | Returns exact SDK setup code with auth configuration                                                                                                                      |
| 5    | `update_activity` (`milestone=auth_configured`)                                   | After the returned SDK/auth configuration has been added to the app, records that credentials are wired into the app and the integration is ready for the first live call |
| 6    | `endpoint_search` (`query=createMessage`)                                         | Returns the method signature, required parameters, and auth requirements for the SMS send endpoint                                                                        |
| 7    | `model_search` (`query=CreateMessageRequest`)                                     | Returns the full typed request model with every available field                                                                                                           |
| 8    | `ask` (`query="How do I handle delivery status callbacks in Next.js?"`)           | Returns webhook handling code aligned to the Twilio SDK                                                                                                                   |

Each step completes in a single tool call. The agent handles the orchestration. You describe the goal, and it picks the right tool at the right time.

## MCP Server

This plugin uses the ContextMatic MCP endpoint:

![paypalsampleapp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc3e5b02-934e-44b5-9df9-20387557babe)

**What was built:** A full Node.js/Express storefront with product management, shareable checkout links per product, PayPal Smart Payment Buttons, server-side order creation and capture, and a payment history dashboard.

**The prompt:**

```
/integrate-context-matic Build me a "PayPal Instant Storefront" app.
The app has a setup page where I enter my PayPal client-id and secret once, then
a product creation form where I enter a product name, description, price, currency,
and upload or provide product images. When I click "Generate Checkout Page" it
creates a live, shareable checkout URL like /checkout/abc123 that anyone can open —
they see the product details with images, price, description, and a working PayPal
Smart Payment Button. The payment flow should be fully server-side using the PayPal
Server SDK: backend creates the order when buyer clicks pay, captures it after
approval, and shows a confirmation page with order details. I should be able to
create multiple products and each gets its own unique checkout link I can share
with anyone. Include a simple dashboard where I can see all my products and their
checkout links, plus a list of completed payments showing order ID, buyer info,
amount, and status for each product. The checkout pages should be mobile-responsive
and look like real professional product pages. Support sandbox and live mode via
environment variables. Only use the Orders API and Payments API, do not use
Transaction Search or Vault. Make it deployable with npm install and npm start.
```

**How the tools were used:**

| Step | Tool              | Query                             | What it returned                                                                                   |
| ---- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `fetch_api`       | `language=typescript`             | Available APIs; identified PayPal Server SDK with key `paypal`                                     |
| 2    | `ask`             | SDK setup & environment switching | Client initialization code, `.env` structure, sandbox vs. live config via `Client.fromEnvironment` |
| 3    | `ask`             | Order creation flow               | End-to-end create → approve → capture flow with full TypeScript server-side code                   |
| 4    | `endpoint_search` | `ordersCreate`                    | `CreateOrder` method signature, `OrderRequest` body structure, response type `Order`, error codes  |
| 5    | `endpoint_search` | `capture`                         | `CaptureOrder` contract — required `id` param, optional body, capture ID location in response      |
| 6    | `model_search`    | `OrderRequest`                    | Full request model properties; flagged `payer` and `application_context` as deprecated             |
| 7    | `model_search`    | `Money`                           | Currency code and value fields for structuring amounts                                             |
| 8    | `ask`             | Smart Payment Buttons             | Frontend button integration — `createOrder` / `onApprove` wiring to backend endpoints              |
| 9    | `endpoint_search` | `getOrder`                        | `GetOrder` method signature and response shape for the confirmation page                           |
| 10   | `model_search`    | `PurchaseUnitRequest`             | Full model with `amount`, `items`, `shipping`, and all optional fields                             |
| 11   | `model_search`    | `Order`                           | Full response model — `status`, `purchaseUnits`, `links` (including the `approve` redirect URL)    |

**App outcome:**

- One-time credential setup page with live sandbox validation
- Product creation with name, description, price, currency, and image upload
- Unique shareable checkout URL per product (`/checkout/abc123`)
- Server-side order creation and capture — no client secrets exposed
- Confirmation page with order ID, buyer info, and capture details
- Dashboard with all products, total revenue, and payment history
- Mobile-responsive checkout pages
- Deployable with `npm install && npm start`

**What was built:** A Python/Flask web app where users authenticate via Spotify OAuth, fetch their top artists and tracks, retrieve audio features in batch, and analyze the data to produce a personalized "Music DNA" card — featuring a radar chart of average audio features, top 5 genres, most obscure artist, and a generated personality label — with a download/share button. Custom branding only; no Spotify logos.

**The prompt:**

```
/integrate-context-matic Create a web app using Python where users log in with Spotify,
fetch their top artists and top tracks, then fetch audio features for those tracks.
Analyze the data to calculate average audio features, find the most obscure artist,
determine the top 5 genres, and generate a "music personality" label based on the
averages. Render all of this in a visually appealing DNA card with a radar chart,
top genres, most obscure artist, and personality label, and include a button to
download or share the card. Use your own branding and logo; do not include Spotify
logos anywhere.

- Retrieves top 50 artists and top 50 tracks (configurable `time_range`: short/medium/long term)
- Batch-fetches audio features for all top tracks via `get_several_audio_features`
- Computes average audio features (danceability, energy, valence, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness) across all tracks
- Identifies the most obscure artist (lowest `popularity` score among top artists)
- Aggregates and ranks top 5 genres from all top artists' genre lists
- Generates a "music personality" label based on average feature thresholds (e.g., "Energetic Explorer", "Melancholic Dreamer", "Chill Acoustic Soul")
- Renders a visually appealing DNA card with:
  - Radar chart (Chart.js) of the 7 average audio features
  - Top 5 genres with visual badges
  - Most obscure artist with name and popularity score
  - Personality label prominently displayed
  - User's display name and avatar
- Download card as PNG and share button (html2canvas)
- Custom branding and logo throughout — no Spotify logos anywhere
- Token refresh handling for long sessions

<summary><strong>Google Maps Restaurant Roulette — PHP · 30 min</strong></summary>

![Google Maps](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Google%20Maps-4285F4?logo=googlemaps&logoColor=white&labelColor=4285F4) ![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PHP-777BB4?logo=php&logoColor=white&labelColor=777BB4) ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=black&labelColor=F7DF1E)

![google-maps-sample-app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eafab114-ccf8-42f9-84c3-bc9706706118)

**What was built:** A PHP web app where users drop a pin (or use their location) on a Google Map, draw a travel-radius circle, and click "Spin" to randomly pick a restaurant within that radius. The app shows Google Places photos, a Street View storefront preview, and one-click directions — with a wheel animation and a "Spin Again" button for gamified suspense. Custom branding; credentials via `.env` file.

**The prompt:**

```
/integrate-context-matic Create a web application using php and google maps platform
apis sdk. for credentials create an env file in which the user will provide the API
Key. The user will Drop a pin (or use your location) on the map, draw a circle for
how far you are willing to travel, and click "spin." The app picks a random restaurant
within that radius, shows you photos from Google Places, a Street View preview of the
storefront, and one-click directions. Not happy with the pick? Spin again. The wheel
animation and suspense make it feel like a game.
```

/integrate-context-matic I need to post a Slack message every time a Spotify
track changes in my playlist monitoring app. Walk me through integrating both APIs
in TypeScript — start by discovering what's available, then show me the auth setup
and the exact API calls.

addresses using Google Maps and cache the results. Look up the geocode endpoint
and response model, then generate the C# code including error handling.

## Typical Use Cases

- Discover which supported APIs are available for a TypeScript, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, Go, or C# project
- Get step-by-step integration guidance for a supported third-party API in the project's language
- Set up authentication, client initialization, and the first API call using version-aware SDK guidance
- Inspect request and response models before writing code that depends on SDK types
- Look up the exact methods, parameters, and response types needed during implementation

## How APIMatic Generates context for an API

![API integration using ContextMatic](https://github.com/apimatic/context-matic/blob/dev/assets/images/image.png?raw=true)

APIMatic takes your OpenAPI specification through the same SDK generation pipeline it uses to produce idiomatic, type-safe SDKs in 10+ languages. The resulting MCP server exposes the SDK documentation and integration patterns as structured tool responses that AI assistants can consume natively.

This means the context the AI receives is:

- Derived from actual generated SDK code, not raw documentation
- Inclusive of idiomatic patterns, typed models, and error handling
- Aligned to the current version of your API spec

For API providers: [request a demo](https://www.apimatic.io/request-demo) to generate context for your API.
