# FlowStudio Power Automate Plugin

Give your AI agent the same visibility you have in the Power Automate portal. The Graph API only returns top-level run status — agents can't see action inputs, loop iterations, nested failures, or who owns a flow. FlowStudio MCP exposes all of it.

This plugin includes five skills covering the full lifecycle: connect, debug, build, monitor, and govern Power Automate cloud flows.

Requires a [FlowStudio MCP](https://mcp.flowstudio.app) subscription.

## What Agents Can't See Today

| What you see in the portal                | What agents see via Graph API    |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Action inputs and outputs                 | Run passed or failed (no detail) |
| Loop iteration data                       | Nothing                          |
| Child flow failures                       | Top-level error code only        |
| Flow health and failure rates             | Nothing                          |
| Who built a flow, what connectors it uses | Nothing                          |

FlowStudio MCP fills these gaps.

## Installation

```bash
copilot plugin install flowstudio-power-automate@awesome-copilot

| Skill                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flowstudio-power-automate-mcp`        | Foundation skill — auth setup, the reusable MCP helper (Python + Node.js), tool discovery via `list_skills`/`tool_search`, oversized-response handling. Load first. |
| `flowstudio-power-automate-debug`      | Step-by-step diagnostic workflow — action-level inputs and outputs, not just error codes. Identifies root cause across nested child flows and loop iterations. |
| `flowstudio-power-automate-build`      | Build and deploy flow definitions from scratch — load `create-flow`, discover connector operations, resolve dynamic options/properties, wire connection templates, deploy, and test via resubmit. |
| `flowstudio-power-automate-monitoring` | Flow health from the cached store — failure rates, run history with remediation hints, maker inventory, Power Apps, environment and connection counts.         |
| `flowstudio-power-automate-governance` | Governance workflows — classify flows by business impact, detect orphaned resources, audit connectors, manage notification rules, compute archive scores.      |

The first three skills call the live Power Automate API. The monitoring and governance skills read from a cached daily snapshot with aggregated stats and governance metadata.

## Prerequisites

- A [FlowStudio MCP](https://mcp.flowstudio.app) subscription
- MCP endpoint: `https://mcp.flowstudio.app/mcp`
- API key (passed as `x-api-key` header — not Bearer)

## Getting Started

1. Install the plugin
2. Get your API key at [mcp.flowstudio.app](https://mcp.flowstudio.app)
3. Configure the MCP connection in VS Code (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "flowstudio": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "https://mcp.flowstudio.app/mcp",
         "headers": { "x-api-key": "<YOUR_TOKEN>" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. Ask Copilot to list your flows, debug a failure, build a new flow, check flow health, or run a governance review
